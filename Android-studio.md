<h1>Rendering error occurs when design a layout</h1>
**Issue:** when passing to design tab of an xml layout file, android studio raises an exeption.</br>
**Fix:** this is an known issue, just change the API level (for example from 24 downto 23), it can be done by clicking on the small android icon on the design/preview tab.
