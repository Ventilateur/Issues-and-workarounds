<h1>Rendering error occurs when design a layout</h1>

**Issue:** when passing to design tab of an xml layout file, android studio raises an exeption.</br>
**Fix:** this is an known issue, just change the API level (for example from 24 downto 23), it can be done by clicking on the small android icon on the design/preview tab.</br>
</br>
<h1>Cannot run from real device</h1>

**Issue:** android studio offer an on-device debug feature, but sometimes it cannot detect the smartphone or whatever.</br>
**Fix:** enable developper mode, then enable debug mode on the device. At the android studio's side, choose *Edit Configurations* in the *Run* tab, then choose *Show Device Chooser Dialog* in the *Target* section.</br>
</br>
**Issue:** android studio says it cannot install APK on the selected device.</br>
**Fix:** this is stupid, but probably the device doesn't have enough free space, so would better clear some.</br>
